## Accounts

**Create a personal account:**

* use "Sign up for a Dataverse account" button on the [login page](https://repository.nfdi4cat.org/loginpage.xhtml?redirectPage=dataverse.xhtml).
* please use your real "Given Name" and "Family Name".
* please set "Username" as combination of **"GivenName.FamilyName"** all with *small letters without quotes*, e.g. **max.mustermann**. This approach will allow us to find each other and share information with each other on an easy way in Dataverse.
* set a real Email address to allow Dataverse to send you notifications. Sometimes it is practical to make some filters in your mailing system to sort emails from Dataverse in a separate folder, because every creation of information will be followed by a mail.
* please set a strong password, e.g. using some password generator or just "openssl rand -base64 18" command in Linux (you can replace "18" with other number to get different length and symbols).

**Permissions and access rights:**

* Basing on the Dataverse access control system users can have different access rights (permissions) in different "dataverses" (here "dataverse" == folder, or similar to folder structure, see useful links above). Every user can create a personal "dataverse" and then decide, what other users can do with this dataverse via the "Edit -> Permissions" button.
* Access to some areas of the repository must be explicitly granted by administrators, see information below.
