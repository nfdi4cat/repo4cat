# Guidelines and Maintenance Documentation

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) as documentation builder with the [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme
and [MySt](https://mystmd.org/) to support extended markdown.

To get an overview about the styling features supported visit the [furo theme documentation](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/kitchen-sink/)
or the [MyST authoring documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/typography).
